Implementation of Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014) in JAX and Flax

To run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```


This will begin the training of a neural turing machine equipped with a feedforward controller on a binary copying task.

I am highly appreciative of criticism and feedback. Please reach out at zengandr@gmail.com!
