# NTMs
(Work in progress)

This repository contains two implementations of a Neural Turing Machine (Graves et al., 2014). One is in JAX and Flax, the other is in Pytorch.

To run:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


run either


```
cd JAX
```


or 


```
cd Pytorch
```

```
python main.py
```


This will begin the training of a neural turing machine equipped with a feedforward controller on a binary copying task.

I am highly appreciative of criticism and feedback. Please reach out by creating an issue!
